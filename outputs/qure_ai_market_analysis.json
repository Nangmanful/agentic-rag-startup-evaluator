Competitive pressure is visible in capital flows, with the EU directing about USD 8.1 billion to AI venture funding annually, while China channels an estimated USD 14.9 billion over the preceding 12-month period and the United States deploys roughly USD 67.9 billion over the same interval.\n\nPeter Jacobs, Director of Private Equity at Carvina Capital, frames the programme as a shift from pilots to production, noting that “policy now pairs capital with clarity on compliance and capability,” and “execution quality over the next four quarters will separate firms that capture measurable productivity from those that only extend experimentation.”\n\nTen priority sectors anchor implementation: healthcare, pharmaceuticals, energy, mobility, manufacturing, construction, agri-food, defence, communications and culture. The emphasis reflects the productivity argument set out by Mario Draghi last September, with practical pathways rather than aspirational slogans. In healthcare, AI-supported screening and diagnostics are positioned to bring earlier detection into hospital workflows this year. Manufacturing and construction focus on robotics and software that remove repetitive labour while lifting throughput within the current fiscal period. Mobility plans expand controlled testing zones for autonomy and intelligent traffic management. Public administrations gain a reusable AI toolbox designed for interoperability. Agri-food deployments concentrate on precision inputs and environmental stewardship over forthcoming growing seasons. Jacobs adds that “investors look for hard baselines and interval gains; these sectors offer the clearest route to verifiable outcomes within one to two reporting cycles.”\n\nOperational scaffolding is designed to reduce friction. An AI Skills Academy runs with USD 8.1 million dedicated to generative-AI training, serving students, SMEs and public administrators. An AI Act Service Desk provides a beta compliance checker so organisations can map legal obligations as rules phase in. One hundred and two Digital Innovation Hubs, including eighty-three supported under the Digital Europe Programme, function as experience centres that furnish testing expertise to firms validating deployments. An Apply AI Alliance opens this month to connect industry with policymakers, while the AI Observatory tracks adoption.\n\nFunding channels extend beyond the USD 1.16 billion headline. Horizon Europe and Digital Europe together commit more than USD 1.16 billion each year to AI in the current programme period. During 2021–2022, Horizon Europe directed about USD 3 billion to AI research and development. Calls released in April last year delivered roughly USD 129.9 million for AI and quantum projects, with USD 58 million targeted at large-model development. RAISE, the virtual institute for AI in science, carries a USD 696 million commitment to secure researcher and start-up access to compute resources, supporting an objective to take annual Horizon Europe AI investment beyond USD 3.5 billion. The Commission’s broader Digital Decade target seeks to mobilise USD 23.2 billion each year from public and private sources, and matching contributions tied to this specific framework lift the immediate pool from USD 1.16 billion to about USD 2.3 billion.\n\nCarvina’s analysis highlights the structural obstacles that still slow scale: fragmented rules across member states, constrained access to high-quality datasets, skills gaps in priority industries and uneven infrastructure. The programme responds with common toolkits, shared indicators and open resources that reduce cross-border frictions. Measurement underpins momentum, with a Joint Research Centre evaluation hub and refreshed Observatory indicators set to monitor adoption, model performance and sector impact on a rolling basis. Jacobs argues that “corporate treasurers and investment committees need comparable metrics over the preceding 12 months and year-to-date; standardised indicators supply the evidence to move from proof-of-concept to budgeted line item.”\n\nMarket depth remains uneven. City-level 2024 totals stand at USD 2.8 billion for Paris, USD 0.8 billion for Munich and USD 0.4 billion for Berlin. Survey work over the preceding 12-month period suggests 90% of participants value AI-driven transport predictions, with 20% indicating willingness to substitute private vehicles for AI-enhanced public transit in controlled pilots. In health, regulators catalogue authorised AI-enabled tools so clinicians can gauge risk, and procurement guidance continues to favour open solutions where they meet tests for security, value for money and interoperability.\n\nFor boards and asset owners, the practical checklist for the current fiscal period is clear: pinpoint near-term productivity levers, map obligations using the service desk, secure reliable data pipelines, and quantify value capture in financial statements. Jacobs contends that “the opportunity in Europe now rests on disciplined delivery. Strategy and funding are visible; the differentiator is whether organisations connect tools, data and governance in ways that withstand audit and still move at the speed that competitive markets require.”\n\n**About Carvina Capital**\n\nCarvina Capital Pte.

Competitive pressure is visible in capital flows, with the EU directing about USD 8.1 billion to AI venture funding annually, while China channels an estimated USD 14.9 billion over the preceding 12-month period and the United States deploys roughly USD 67.9 billion over the same interval.\n\nPeter Jacobs, Director of Private Equity at Carvina Capital, frames the programme as a shift from pilots to production, noting that “policy now pairs capital with clarity on compliance and capability,” and “execution quality over the next four quarters will separate firms that capture measurable productivity from those that only extend experimentation.”\n\nTen priority sectors anchor implementation: healthcare, pharmaceuticals, energy, mobility, manufacturing, construction, agri-food, defence, communications and culture. The emphasis reflects the productivity argument set out by Mario Draghi last September, with practical pathways rather than aspirational slogans. In healthcare, AI-supported screening and diagnostics are positioned to bring earlier detection into hospital workflows this year. Manufacturing and construction focus on robotics and software that remove repetitive labour while lifting throughput within the current fiscal period. Mobility plans expand controlled testing zones for autonomy and intelligent traffic management. Public administrations gain a reusable AI toolbox designed for interoperability. Agri-food deployments concentrate on precision inputs and environmental stewardship over forthcoming growing seasons. Jacobs adds that “investors look for hard baselines and interval gains; these sectors offer the clearest route to verifiable outcomes within one to two reporting cycles.”\n\nOperational scaffolding is designed to reduce friction. An AI Skills Academy runs with USD 8.1 million dedicated to generative-AI training, serving students, SMEs and public administrators. An AI Act Service Desk provides a beta compliance checker so organisations can map legal obligations as rules phase in. One hundred and two Digital Innovation Hubs, including eighty-three supported under the Digital Europe Programme, function as experience centres that furnish testing expertise to firms validating deployments. An Apply AI Alliance opens this month to connect industry with policymakers, while the AI Observatory tracks adoption.\n\nFunding channels extend beyond the USD 1.16 billion headline. Horizon Europe and Digital Europe together commit more than USD 1.16 billion each year to AI in the current programme period. During 2021–2022, Horizon Europe directed about USD 3 billion to AI research and development. Calls released in April last year delivered roughly USD 129.9 million for AI and quantum projects, with USD 58 million targeted at large-model development. RAISE, the virtual institute for AI in science, carries a USD 696 million commitment to secure researcher and start-up access to compute resources, supporting an objective to take annual Horizon Europe AI investment beyond USD 3.5 billion. The Commission’s broader Digital Decade target seeks to mobilise USD 23.2 billion each year from public and private sources, and matching contributions tied to this specific framework lift the immediate pool from USD 1.16 billion to about USD 2.3 billion.\n\nCarvina’s analysis highlights the structural obstacles that still slow scale: fragmented rules across member states, constrained access to high-quality datasets, skills gaps in priority industries and uneven infrastructure. The programme responds with common toolkits, shared indicators and open resources that reduce cross-border frictions. Measurement underpins momentum, with a Joint Research Centre evaluation hub and refreshed Observatory indicators set to monitor adoption, model performance and sector impact on a rolling basis. Jacobs argues that “corporate treasurers and investment committees need comparable metrics over the preceding 12 months and year-to-date; standardised indicators supply the evidence to move from proof-of-concept to budgeted line item.”\n\nMarket depth remains uneven. City-level 2024 totals stand at USD 2.8 billion for Paris, USD 0.8 billion for Munich and USD 0.4 billion for Berlin. Survey work over the preceding 12-month period suggests 90% of participants value AI-driven transport predictions, with 20% indicating willingness to substitute private vehicles for AI-enhanced public transit in controlled pilots. In health, regulators catalogue authorised AI-enabled tools so clinicians can gauge risk, and procurement guidance continues to favour open solutions where they meet tests for security, value for money and interoperability.\n\nFor boards and asset owners, the practical checklist for the current fiscal period is clear: pinpoint near-term productivity levers, map obligations using the service desk, secure reliable data pipelines, and quantify value capture in financial statements. Jacobs contends that “the opportunity in Europe now rests on disciplined delivery. Strategy and funding are visible; the differentiator is whether organisations connect tools, data and governance in ways that withstand audit and still move at the speed that competitive markets require.”\n\n**About Carvina Capital**\n\nCarvina Capital Pte.

Jain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sachinjain/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sachinjain/\"),\n\nForbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.\n\n I cover transformation and innovation across the health care industry.\n\nArtificial intelligence is the most hyped and misunderstood force in healthcare today. For all the headlines about breakthrough models and digital transformation, the true question is whether we’ve built the infrastructure to make those innovations usable, safe, and scalable.As someone who leads a large health plan serving hundreds of thousands of older adults, I see both the promise and the peril of AI every day. It has the potential to transform how we deliver care — but also to widen inequities and create new risks if we fail to manage it thoughtfully.To better understand what it will take to build AI systems that are secure, responsive, and clinically meaningful, I interviewed Greg Dorai, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Switching at Cisco. Dorai oversees some of the most advanced networking technologies in the world — and he argues that the key to AI’s success in healthcare isn’t just smarter algorithms, but smarter infrastructure.What follows is our conversation about AI’s transformative potential and pitfalls.\n\n## How do you see AI changing healthcare?\n\nAI is already reshaping healthcare across clinical care, operations, and research. Clinically, it enables earlier and more precise diagnoses, more personalized treatments, and improved outcomes. Operationally, it streamlines workflows, reduces errors, and improves efficiency. In research, it accelerates drug discovery and clinical trial matching, while in education, AI-driven simulations are transforming how medical professionals train.These benefits are no longer theoretical. Predictive AI models now help hospitals anticipate bed occupancy, improving resource allocation and patient flow. In breast cancer screening, AI has increased detection rates without raising false positives. But these applications depend on a network infrastructure capable of handling exponentially larger workloads.Scaling the benefits of AI safely and consistently will require more than algorithms. It will demand secure, high-speed, low-latency networks that ensure intelligence is shared and acted upon in real time — exactly when and where care is delivered.\n\n## What are the potential pitfalls of AI in healthcare?\n\nThe risks are as real as the opportunities. Algorithms trained on narrow datasets may miss critical signals when applied to broader populations. Tools that perform well in research can introduce friction in clinical practice.Cybersecurity is perhaps the greatest concern. Healthcare is already the leading target for cyberattacks due to its sensitive data and reliance on connected devices. As AI expands across hospitals, clinics, and homes, the attack surface grows significantly.Protecting AI data flow requires more than endpoint defenses. It calls for intelligent networks that can automatically decide who or what can connect, what they can access, and for how long — all at the same speed that AI workloads operate. And all without adding complexity for those who build and manage them.\n\n## How can AI enhance the patient experience in healthcare?\n\nFor patients, AI promises faster, more personalized, and more connected care. It can enable earlier diagnoses, tailor treatments, and reduce friction in how people interact with the healthcare system.Remote monitoring is a powerful example. Wearable cardiac devices can detect early signs of arrhythmia and alert care teams in time to intervene. But those insights only matter if the underlying network delivers them securely and instantly to the right clinician.As care continues to extend beyond hospitals — into clinics, campuses, and homes — trusted connectivity becomes the foundation for patients to benefit fully from AI-enabled care. In the age of AI, the network is the critical infrastructure for the critical moments in healthcare.\n\n## How can AI enhance the workforce experience in healthcare?\n\nAI can dramatically improve the workforce experience by automating routine tasks, offering decision support, and enriching training — giving clinicians more time to focus on care.Generative AI scribes are already reducing the burden of note-taking. Predictive tools are improving staffing efficiency. And advanced simulations are strengthening skills for complex procedures, as we see in robotic surgery today.The challenge now is scale. To extend these benefits across every care setting — from operating rooms to home health — organizations need network infrastructure capable of handling high-compute, low-latency workloads securely and reliably.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nAs Dorai notes, the future of AI in healthcare will depend less on the brilliance of algorithms and more on the robustness of the systems that connect them. If AI is the brain of the new healthcare ecosystem, the network is its nervous system — transmitting intelligence safely, instantly, and reliably across every node of care.The hospitals, health plans, and systems that recognize this early will not only deliver smarter care — they’ll deliver fairer, faster, and more connected care. The age of AI in healthcare won’t be won by the best code, but by the best connectivity.\n\n***Editor’s Note***: This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity and flow.\n\n[Editorial Standards](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/)[Reprints & Permissions](https://www.parsintl.com/publications/forbes/)\n\nLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video</raw></document>"
